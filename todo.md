# ToDos:

## After saving Newsletter

* Perhaps: Asynchronous creation of subscriptions

## Current Signout function

* should use Subscription removing

## Misc

* Signout must be viewed.

* Signup process must be viewed.

## Investigations

* When a user subscribes to a newsletter for the first time, the subscription will probably not created because he is not verified. We need to create the subscription when the user verifies his contact. Do we still know the newsletter the subscription has to be created for?
