# ToDos:

* Perhaps: Asynchronous creation of subscriptions??

* pending deliveries has to also count additional emails (??)

* counter cache for tag contacts_count?? -> PR for acts-as-taggable-on

* sending mails slows down the server. we should check rendering of mails and speed this up if possible.

* opening delivery statistics takes long

* newsletter edit form -> contactgroups select with js filter box like contactgroups form tag select.

* implement subscriptions handling workflow for contacts

* FIX export contact as vcf

* Fix import of exported file
  - exported file has one new line too much
  - Fix the mapper (columns in dropdowns are english)
  - Add verified as column to mapper

* Check Mailing#show
  - as anonymous
  - as contact / recipient

* Check unsubscribe

* contact_group edit form is very slow

* creating lots of subscriptions takes too long
